Another one of Aunt Judy's notes. Here we go! #speaker: Album
"The shop hasn't been doing well these days, the catmosphere is strange."
"Hector, the part-timer, says I'm just imagining things."
"But I swear, the place seems haunted now! I feel like I'm being watched!"
Aunt Judy sensed the same strangeness that I noticed with the store too!
"I'm going to try burning some catnip for good luck."
Ugh. Seems like it didn't work. Aunt Judy...
