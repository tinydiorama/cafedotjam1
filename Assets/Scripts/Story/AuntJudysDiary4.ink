Aunt Judy's diary. Let's hear what happened next. #speaker: Album
"Hector quit today. I guess the records flying off the wall did it finally."
"I can't blame him one bit - it's not like we have any customers anyway."
"I keep hearing strange sounds from the back storeroom."
"Managing this store is a battle. I'll go on the record saying that."
Aunt Judy really was struggling, wasn't she? I have to know what happened next.
I'll purrsue this to the very end!
