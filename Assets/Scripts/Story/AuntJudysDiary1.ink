Hmm... Aunt Judy's Audio Diary, on record! How spicy... !#speaker: Album
Let's listen...
"Another day at the shop. I can't keep up with so many customers!"
Hmph. Must be nice.
"The shop is doing so well and my life is purr-fect!"
"Tonight I'm going to meet up with the girls for our 'club meeting.'"
Wow, Aunt Judy was livin' it up, huh?
