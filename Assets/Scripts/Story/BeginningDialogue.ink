I've been working my whiskers off for months and hardly any customers come in.#speaker: Alma "Album" Scratch
Aunt Judy always said, 'Managing the store is a constant battle!'#speaker: Album
What a weird thing to say since the store is so empty. No wonder she was in so much debt.
Hmm. I know why no one comes in. There's something so spooky about this place.
Every meow and then, I feel like I'm being watched.
I've never even been in the back storeroom - it gives me the creeps.
But it's silly, right? What could pawssibly be there? Some boxes? A mop? 
It's time to stop being a timid kitten. I need to get this shop in order.
