Aunt Judy's final notes. It's time to stop kitten around. #speaker: Album
"I've had enough. The store has sung its final tune and I've got nothing to lose."
"There's no use crying over spilt milk."
"I've never lost a DJ battle before and I won't be defeated now."
"I've packed my things and I'm heading to the storeroom."
Aunt Judy... what happened to you?
