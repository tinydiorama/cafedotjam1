Another one of Aunt Judy's notes...#speaker: Album
Let's listen.
"Last night was weird. I met up with the girls, and we hit up the town."
"Got challenged for another DJ battle. These punks always think they can win."
Wow, Aunt Judy. A DJ? For real? Wow.
"Of course, no one can scratch records like me. He ran away mewling. But..."
"Before he left, he said, 'You think you bested me? I curse thee to a life of nothing but cat-astrophe!'"
"... what a weird DJ."
Hmm. Wow. Looks like there's a lot I didn't know about Aunt Judy.
